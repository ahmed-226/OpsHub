Project Name
URL Shortener

------------------------------------------------------------

Project Idea
This project, developed by Team OpsHub, aims to build a functional, containerized URL shortener webservice with full observability using modern DevOps tools.

The URL shortener allows users to:
- Shorten long URLs into concise links
- Store URL mappings in a PostgreSQL database
- Redirect users from short URLs to their original destinations

To ensure reliability and performance monitoring, the service is instrumented to expose custom metrics.
These metrics are collected by Prometheus and visualized using Grafana.
The entire stack is orchestrated using Kubernetes, making it scalable and resilient.
It can be run locally using a cluster like Minikube or Docker Desktop Kubernetes.
